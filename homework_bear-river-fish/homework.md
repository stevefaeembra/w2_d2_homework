# Bears, River, Fish

We are going to build a small ecosystem! We want to create an ecosystem made up of 3 parts: bears, river and fish. You will need a class for each of these. From this you can make instances and build your ecosystem.

## How Our Ecosystem Works

- A river should have a name e.g. "Amazon" [done]
- A river should hold many fish [done]
- A fish should have a name [done]

- A bear should have a name e.g. "Yogi" and a type e.g. "Grizzly" [done]
- A bear should have an empty stomach ( maybe an array ) [done]

- A bear should be able to take a fish from the river [done]
- A river should lose a fish when a bear takes a fish [done]

## Extensions

- A bear could have a roar method [done]
- A bear could have a food_count method [done]
- A river could have a fish_count method
